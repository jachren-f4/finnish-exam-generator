## Mock Data and Test Environment Setup

### **Development Database Setup**
```sql
-- Test students
INSERT INTO students (user_id, name, grade) VALUES
  ('test-user-1', 'Aino Virtanen', 3),
  ('test-user-1', 'Eetu Korhonen', 6);

-- Test exams with different statuses
INSERT INTO exams (user_id, student_id, subject, status) VALUES
  ('test-user-1', 'student-1', 'Maantieto', 'READY'),
  ('test-user-1', 'student-2', 'Historia', 'PROCESSING');
```

### **Mock API Responses**
```javascript
// Mock exam questions for development
const mockExamQuestions = {
  questions: [
    { id: 1, text: "MikÃ¤ on Suomen pÃ¤Ã¤kaupunki?" },
    { id: 2, text: "Milloin Suomi itsenÃ¤istyi?" },
    // ... 8 more questions
  ]
};
```
