# Project Evolution: Finnish Exam Generator

## Project Overview
A Finnish exam generation system that uses Gemini AI for OCR processing of images to extract text and generate exam questions, with intelligent AI-powered grading capabilities.

## System Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with JSONB fields
- **AI Service**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
- **Mobile**: Flutter app for multi-image uploads
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Development Timeline & Key Changes

### Phase 1: Initial System Discovery
**Status**: Pre-existing system with basic functionality
- Web-based exam generator using image OCR
- Simple rule-based grading (string matching)
- Basic question generation from images
- Supabase database with `exams`, `answers`, and `grading` tables

### Phase 2: Core Problem Identification
**Issue Discovered**: Rule-based grading was producing incorrect results
- Example: "Viulu ja kitara" (violin and guitar) receiving 0 points despite being correct
- Simple string matching couldn't handle:
  - Synonyms and alternative expressions
  - Partial answers
  - Context-dependent responses
  - Finnish language variations

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Grading Implementation
**Major Enhancement**: Replaced rule-based with Gemini AI grading

#### Changes Made:
1. **Created `gradeQuestionWithGemini()` function**
   - Sends question + expected answer + student response to Gemini
   - 3-step analytical process for question-aware evaluation
   - Finnish language grading criteria (4-10 scale)
   - Intelligent fallback to rule-based for reliability

2. **Enhanced Database Schema**
   - Added `grading_prompt` field to `grading` table
   - Enhanced `grading_json` to include grading metadata
   - Added usage tracking for API costs

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Enhanced grading results page with method indicators
   - Added detailed grading reasoning display
   - Cost tracking and API usage statistics
   - Grading metadata section showing AI vs rule-based stats

### Phase 4: Question-Answer Consistency Issues
**Problem**: Question requirements didn't match expected answers
- Example: Question asked for "two instruments" but expected answer contained three
- Led to inconsistent grading even with AI

#### Solution: Question-Aware Grading Enhancement
1. **Enhanced Grading Prompt** with 3-step process:
   - Analyze question requirements first
   - Compare expected answer to question requirements
   - Evaluate student answer against question needs (not just expected answer)

2. **Priority System**: Question requirements override expected answer format

### Phase 5: Question Generation Improvements
**Issue**: Generated questions lacked context and clarity
- Questions didn't make sense for Finnish students
- Lacked self-contained information

#### Solutions:
1. **Enhanced Question Generation Prompts**
   - Added requirement for self-contained questions
   - Prohibited contextual references
   - Improved Finnish educational standards alignment

2. **Prompt Storage**: Added database storage for grading prompts used

### Phase 6: Model Standardization & Cost Tracking
**Discovery**: System was using inconsistent Gemini models
- OCR: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- Grading: `gemini-1.5-flash-8b`

#### Standardization Changes:
1. **Unified Model**: Both systems now use `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
2. **Comprehensive Cost Tracking**:
   - Added detailed cost calculations (input/output/total)
   - Enhanced usage metadata with model information
   - Proper Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite pricing implementation

### Phase 7: Multi-Image Flutter Support
**Enhancement**: Extended system for mobile Flutter app

#### Changes:
1. **API Endpoint Updates**:
   - Enhanced `/api/mobile/exam-questions` for multi-image support
   - Maintained backward compatibility

2. **Flutter Integration Specification**:
   - Created detailed HTTP request specification
   - FormData construction guidelines
   - Multi-image upload handling (1-20 images, 10MB each)
   - Field naming conventions (`images`, not `images[]`)

## Current System Capabilities

### Core Features
1. **Multi-Image OCR Processing**
   - Supports 1-20 images per request
   - HEIC/HEIF to JPEG conversion (handled by Flutter client)
   - Image optimization and compression (handled by Flutter client)

2. **AI-Powered Question Generation**
   - Self-contained questions suitable for Finnish students
   - Multiple question types (fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, etc.)
   - Context-aware content extraction

3. **Intelligent Grading System**
   - Question-aware evaluation prioritizing requirements
   - Finnish educational standards (4-10 grading scale)
   - Hybrid approach (AI + rule-based fallback)
   - Detailed reasoning and feedback

4. **Cost Tracking & Analytics**
   - Token usage monitoring
   - Detailed cost breakdowns
   - API usage statistics
   - Model performance metrics

### Database Structure
- **`exams` table**: Stores exam data, prompts, and metadata
- **`answers` table**: Student responses
- **`grading` table**: Grading results with AI metadata and costs

### Cost Storage Status
- **OCR Costs**: ❌ Not stored in database (only in API responses)
- **Grading Costs**: ✅ Stored in `grading.grading_json` field

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- Fixed missing interface properties during Vercel deployment
- Resolved Next.js 15 async params issues
- Enhanced error handling for HTML/DOCTYPE responses

### 2. Model Version Inconsistencies
- Standardized to single Gemini model across all operations
- Updated pricing calculations to match actual model used
- Corrected pricing comments and documentation

### 3. Question-Answer Misalignment
- Implemented question-first evaluation approach
- Added requirement analysis step in grading
- Enhanced prompt engineering for better question generation

### 4. Mobile Integration
- Created comprehensive Flutter integration guide
- Standardized multipart form data handling
- Maintained API backward compatibility

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. Missing OCR Cost Storage
- OCR processing costs are calculated but not persisted to database
- Should be added to `exams` table for complete cost tracking

### 2. Pricing Accuracy
- Current pricing based on Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite rates
- Need verification of actual Google pricing for accuracy

## Project Impact
1. **Accuracy Improvement**: From simple string matching to contextual AI evaluation
2. **Cost Transparency**: Comprehensive tracking of AI API usage and costs
3. **Mobile Support**: Extended capabilities to Flutter applications
4. **Educational Value**: Proper Finnish language and educational standards integration
5. **Scalability**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Future Considerations
1. Implement OCR cost storage in database
2. Real-time cost monitoring and alerting
3. Advanced analytics and reporting
4. Multi-language support expansion
5. Enhanced question type variety
