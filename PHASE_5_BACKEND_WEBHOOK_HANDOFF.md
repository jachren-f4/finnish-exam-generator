# üîó Phase 5: Backend Webhook Processing - Handoff Document

**For**: Backend Development Team
**Purpose**: Implement RevenueCat webhook processing to sync subscription data with Supabase
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Status**: Ready for implementation

---

## üìã Executive Summary

The Flutter app integrates with RevenueCat for subscription management and Superwall for paywalls. When users subscribe, cancel, or renew, RevenueCat sends webhooks to your backend. Your job is to:

1. **Receive webhooks** from RevenueCat
2. **Validate signatures** to ensure data integrity
3. **Process events** (purchase, renewal, cancellation, refund, expiration)
4. **Update Supabase** subscription records
5. **Track history** for analytics and debugging

This document provides everything you need.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Part 1: Supabase Schema Reference

### Table 1: `subscriptions`

This is the main table tracking user subscription status.

```sql
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  subscription_status TEXT NOT NULL,
  trial_started_at TIMESTAMP,
  trial_expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  is_trial_expired BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  subscription_expiry TIMESTAMP,
  revenuecat_customer_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  user_currency TEXT,
  user_country TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Column Details:**

| Column | Type | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `user_id` | UUID | Primary key | Links to auth.users.id |
| `subscription_status` | TEXT | Current status | See enum below |
| `trial_started_at` | TIMESTAMP | Trial start date | Set when trial initiated (app-side) |
| `trial_expires_at` | TIMESTAMP | Trial end date | Set when trial initiated (app-side) |
| `is_trial_expired` | BOOLEAN | Trial status | Set by app or backend check |
| `subscription_expiry` | TIMESTAMP | When subscription ends | **Updated by webhook** |
| `revenuecat_customer_id` | TEXT | RevenueCat ID | Unique per user, maps webhook events |
| `user_currency` | TEXT | Billing currency | e.g., "USD", "EUR", "GBP" |
| `user_country` | TEXT | User country | Used for geo-specific pricing |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Record creation | Auto-set |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | Last update | Auto-set on each webhook |

**Subscription Status Enum Values:**
```
- "unactivated"       (user hasn't created first exam yet)
- "free_trial"        (user is in 3-day trial)
- "premium_weekly"    (active weekly subscription)
- "premium_annual"    (active annual subscription)
- "cancelled"         (subscription cancelled, may still be valid if not expired)
```

---

### Table 2: `subscription_history`

Audit trail for all subscription changes. Use this for analytics, debugging, and chargeback disputes.

```sql
CREATE TABLE subscription_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  previous_status TEXT,
  new_status TEXT,
  revenuecat_event_id TEXT,
  revenuecat_transaction_id TEXT,
  product_id TEXT,
  price NUMERIC,
  currency TEXT,
  webhook_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  raw_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Column Details:**

| Column | Type | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique record ID | Auto-generated |
| `user_id` | UUID | User being affected | Links to subscriptions.user_id |
| `event_type` | TEXT | What happened | See webhook events below |
| `previous_status` | TEXT | Status before change | For tracking transitions |
| `new_status` | TEXT | Status after change | For tracking transitions |
| `revenuecat_event_id` | TEXT | RevenueCat event ID | Prevents duplicate processing |
| `revenuecat_transaction_id` | TEXT | Transaction ID | Links to purchase |

## üîë Part 2: RevenueCat Integration Details

### Webhook Endpoint Configuration

**Your endpoint should be:**
```
POST https://your-backend.com/api/webhooks/revenuecat
```

### RevenueCat Webhook Setup (Already Configured)

In RevenueCat dashboard (already done by user):
- **Staging App**: RevenueCat Staging configured
- **Products Created**:
  - `examgenie_weekly` - $4.99/week
  - `examgenie_annual` - $49.99/year
- **Offerings Created**:
  - "standard" offering with both products

**Your backend needs to:**
1. Register this webhook endpoint in RevenueCat dashboard
2. Receive and validate webhook payloads
3. Handle all webhook event types

### RevenueCat API Keys

The following are already configured:
- **Staging API Key**: Available in RevenueCat account (backend team should fetch from secrets)
- **Production API Key**: Will be available when moving to production

---

## üì® Part 3: Webhook Events & Processing

### Event Types to Handle

RevenueCat sends these events (you need to handle all):

#### 1. INITIAL_PURCHASE
**When**: User buys a subscription (not a trial)

**Webhook Payload Structure:**
```json
{
  "event": {
    "type": "INITIAL_PURCHASE",
    "id": "unique-event-id-12345",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-22T14:30:00Z"
  },
  "app": {
    "name": "ExamGenie"
  },
  "subscriber": {
    "id": "revenuecat_customer_id_xyz"
  },
  "product": {
    "id": "examgenie_weekly",
    "type": "subscription"
  },
  "price": {
    "amount": 4.99,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "transaction": {
    "id": "transaction-12345",
    "purchaseDate": "2024-10-22T14:30:00Z"
  },
  "expiration": {
    "date": "2024-10-29T14:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Processing Steps:**
1. Extract `subscriber.id` ‚Üí lookup user by `revenuecat_customer_id`
2. Extract `product.id` ‚Üí map to subscription_status:
   - "examgenie_weekly" ‚Üí "premium_weekly"
   - "examgenie_annual" ‚Üí "premium_annual"
3. Extract `expiration.date` ‚Üí set as `subscription_expiry`
4. Set `updated_at` = now()
5. Create history record with event_type = "INITIAL_PURCHASE"

**SQL Update Pattern:**
```sql
UPDATE subscriptions
SET
  subscription_status = $1,
  subscription_expiry = $2,
  updated_at = now()
WHERE revenuecat_customer_id = $3;

INSERT INTO subscription_history (...) VALUES (...)
```

---

#### 2. RENEWAL
**When**: Active subscription renews (weekly or annual)

**Webhook Payload:**
```json
{
  "event": {
    "type": "RENEWAL",
    "id": "unique-event-id-67890"
  },
  "subscriber": {
    "id": "revenuecat_customer_id_xyz"
  },
  "product": {
    "id": "examgenie_weekly"
  },
  "expiration": {
    "date": "2024-10-29T14:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Processing Steps:**
1. Extract user by `subscriber.id`
2. Confirm `subscription_status` is still "premium_weekly" or "premium_annual"
3. Update `subscription_expiry` to new expiration date
4. Create history record with event_type = "RENEWAL"

**Note**: Do NOT change subscription_status on renewal, just extend expiry date.

---

#### 3. CANCELLATION
**When**: User cancels subscription (may still be valid until expiry)

**Webhook Payload:**
```json
{
  "event": {
    "type": "CANCELLATION",
    "id": "unique-event-id-11111"
  },
  "subscriber": {
    "id": "revenuecat_customer_id_xyz"
  },
  "product": {
    "id": "examgenie_weekly"
  },
  "expiration": {
    "date": "2024-10-29T14:30:00Z",
    "cancellationReason": "UNSUBSCRIBE"
  }
}
```

**Processing Steps:**
1. Extract user by `subscriber.id`
2. Set `subscription_status` = "cancelled"
3. Keep `subscription_expiry` as-is (user still has access until this date)
4. Create history record with event_type = "CANCELLATION"
5. Set `previous_status` = current status, `new_status` = "cancelled"

**Important**: Cancelled ‚â† expired. User can still create exams until `subscription_expiry` passes.

---

#### 4. REFUND
**When**: User gets refunded (full or partial)

**Webhook Payload:**
```json
{
  "event": {
    "type": "REFUND",
    "id": "unique-event-id-22222"
  },
  "subscriber": {
    "id": "revenuecat_customer_id_xyz"
  },
  "product": {
    "id": "examgenie_weekly"
  },
  "transaction": {
    "id": "transaction-12345"
  },
  "price": {
    "amount": 4.99,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

**Processing Steps:**
1. Extract user by `subscriber.id`
2. Set `subscription_status` = "cancelled" (revoke access immediately)
3. Create history record with event_type = "REFUND"
4. Store refund amount and transaction ID for accounting

**Note**: Refunds revoke access immediately.

---

#### 5. EXPIRATION
**When**: RevenueCat detects a subscription has expired (optional event)

**Processing Steps:**
1. Extract user by `subscriber.id`
2. Check if `subscription_expiry` has passed
3. If passed, set `subscription_status` = "free_trial_expired" (if was premium, now they're blocked)
4. Set `is_trial_expired` = true

**Note**: This is optional since app-side checks also verify expiry. Use as backup.

---

#### 6. SUBSCRIPTION_EXTENDED (Not Required, But Nice-to-Have)
If RevenueCat sends this, same as RENEWAL.

---

### Events to Ignore

These are sent by RevenueCat but you don't need to process them:
- `PRODUCT_CHANGE` - User switches products (we treat as cancellation + new purchase)
- `BILLING_ISSUE` - Informational only
- `TEST_PURCHASE` - Ignore in production

---

## üîê Part 4: Webhook Signature Validation

**Critical**: Validate every webhook to prevent spoofing.

### Validation Steps

1. **Get RevenueCat Public Key** from RevenueCat documentation
2. **Extract signature** from webhook header: `X-RevenueCat-Signature`
3. **Verify signature** using the public key and webhook body
4. **Reject** if validation fails (return 401)

### Implementation (Pseudo-code)

```python
import hmac
import hashlib
import base64

def validate_revenuecat_webhook(request_body: bytes, signature_header: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validate RevenueCat webhook signature.

    Args:
        request_body: Raw request body (bytes)
        signature_header: Value of X-RevenueCat-Signature header

    Returns:
        True if valid, False otherwise
    """
    # Get RevenueCat public key from environment or config
    REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv("REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY")

    # Compute HMAC-SHA256
    computed_signature = base64.b64encode(
        hmac.new(
            REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY.encode(),
            request_body,
            hashlib.sha256
        ).digest()
    ).decode()

    # Compare signatures (timing-safe comparison)
    return hmac.compare_digest(computed_signature, signature_header)


@app.post("/api/webhooks/revenuecat")
def handle_revenuecat_webhook(request):
    # Validate signature
    signature = request.headers.get("X-RevenueCat-Signature")
    if not validate_revenuecat_webhook(request.body, signature):
        return {"error": "Invalid signature"}, 401

    # Process webhook
    process_webhook(request.json)

    return {"success": true}, 200
```

---

## üîÑ Part 5: Workflow & Data Mapping

### Step-by-Step Processing Workflow

```
Webhook arrives
    ‚Üì
1. Extract signature, validate ‚úì ‚Üí Reject if invalid
    ‚Üì
2. Extract revenuecat_customer_id from subscriber.id
    ‚Üì
3. Query subscriptions table for matching revenuecat_customer_id
    ‚Üì
4. If not found:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Check if user exists in auth.users (by linking method)
    ‚îú‚îÄ If exists: Create new subscriptions row
    ‚îî‚îÄ If not exists: Log error, return 400
    ‚Üì
5. Based on event.type, update subscription_status and/or subscription_expiry
    ‚Üì
6. Create audit record in subscription_history
    ‚Üì
7. Return 200 OK to RevenueCat
```

---

### Product ID to Status Mapping

RevenueCat Product ID ‚Üí Subscription Status:

| RevenueCat Product ID | Status | Details |
|----------------------|--------|---------|
| `examgenie_weekly` | `premium_weekly` | $4.99/week |
| `examgenie_annual` | `premium_annual` | $49.99/year |

---

### Event Type Handling Matrix

| Event | Previous Status | New Status | Update Expiry | Action |
|-------|-----------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| INITIAL_PURCHASE | unactivated / free_trial | premium_weekly / premium_annual | ‚úÖ YES | Grant access immediately |
| RENEWAL | premium_weekly / premium_annual | (same) | ‚úÖ YES | Extend access |
| CANCELLATION | premium_* | cancelled | ‚ùå NO | Mark cancelled, access expires at date |
| REFUND | premium_* | cancelled | ‚ùå NO | Revoke immediately |
| EXPIRATION | premium_* | free_trial_expired | ‚ùå NO | Block, move back to free tier |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Part 6: Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Duplicate Event Prevention

RevenueCat may send the same event multiple times (network retries). Prevent duplicate processing:

```python
def process_webhook(event_data):
    # Check if we've already processed this event
    existing = subscription_history.find_one({
        "revenuecat_event_id": event_data["event"]["id"]
    })

    if existing:
        print(f"Duplicate event {event_data['event']['id']}, skipping")
        return 200  # Return OK (idempotent)

    # Process normally
    ...
```

---

### User Not Found

If `revenuecat_customer_id` doesn't match any user:

```
1. Log error with full webhook payload
2. Store webhook in pending_webhooks table for manual review
3. Return 202 ACCEPTED (don't retry)
4. Alert ops team
```

**Investigation**: This likely means the user ID wasn't linked in RevenueCat when they subscribed. Fallback:
- Check if email exists in both systems
- Manually link `revenuecat_customer_id` to user_id

---

### Concurrent Updates

If two webhooks arrive simultaneously for the same user:

```python
# Use database-level locking
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM subscriptions WHERE user_id = $1 FOR UPDATE;  -- Lock row
UPDATE subscriptions SET ...
INSERT INTO subscription_history ...
COMMIT;
```

---

### Time Zone Handling

All timestamps from RevenueCat are in **UTC ISO-8601 format**:
- Receive: `"2024-10-22T14:30:00Z"`
- Store in Supabase as: `timestamp with time zone`
- Always work in UTC

---
