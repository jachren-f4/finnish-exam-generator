# Language Detection Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement automatic language detection for exam generation by removing language specifications from LLM prompts, allowing Gemini to naturally detect and match the source material's language.

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:**
- ✅ Remove language strings from LLM prompts only
- ❌ Do NOT remove language parameters from APIs, interfaces, or database fields
- ❌ Do NOT remove any fields or break API contracts
- ✅ Keep all existing parameters in place (they may be used elsewhere)
- ✅ Test with localhost backend + curl commands using `/assets/images/photo1.jpg`

## Current State Analysis

### What Currently Happens
- Language is passed as a parameter (`language: string = 'en'`)
- `LanguageService.getLanguageName(language)` converts code to full name
- Language is injected into prompts as a variable: `"Questions must sound natural in ${languageName}"`
- Default fallback is English ('en')
- `DEFAULT_EXAM_GENERATION` prompt hardcodes Finnish

### What Will Change
- **Prompts:** Remove language variable interpolation from prompt strings
- **Prompts:** Add simple instruction to match source material language
- **Everything else:** Keep unchanged (APIs, interfaces, database, etc.)

### Files to Modify (Prompts Only)
- `/src/lib/config.ts` - Update prompt template strings only

## Detailed Task List

### Phase 1: Prompt Analysis & Mapping
- [x] **Task 1.1:** Scan `/src/lib/config.ts` for all language variable usage
  - ✅ Found 6 instances of `${languageName}` in prompt strings
  - ✅ Found 5 instances of `${studentLanguageName}` in prompt strings
  - ✅ Found 3 hardcoded "in Finnish" references
  - ✅ Documented all prompts needing updates

- [x] **Task 1.2:** Search entire codebase for language in prompts
  - ✅ Searched all .ts files in src/ directory
  - ✅ Confirmed only config.ts contains prompt templates
  - ✅ language-service.ts uses languageName but not in prompts

### Phase 2: Update Prompt Templates (config.ts ONLY)

- [x] **Task 2.1:** Update `DEFAULT_EXAM_GENERATION` prompt
  - ✅ Removed 2 hardcoded "in Finnish" references
  - ✅ Added instruction: "Use the same language as the source material for all questions and explanations"
  - ✅ Function signature unchanged (still a constant)
  - ✅ JSON structure requirements remain clear

- [x] **Task 2.2:** Update `getSimplifiedCategoryPrompt()` function
  - ✅ **Kept function signature unchanged** (language parameter retained)
  - ✅ Removed `LanguageService.getLanguageName(language)` call

  - ✅ Added auto-detection instructions:
    - "Detect the student's native language from context"
    - "Detect the target foreign language being taught"
    - "Use detected student's native language for instructions"
  - ✅ Parameter remains but unused in prompt string

- [x] **Task 2.5:** Review `OCR_EXTRACTION` prompt
  - ✅ Reviewed - no language variables found
  - ✅ Already language-agnostic
  - ✅ No changes needed

### Phase 3: Testing Setup

  - ✅ Language detection is transparent to API users
  - ✅ Parameters remain unchanged (backward compatible)
  - ✅ No breaking changes to document

## Special Considerations

### Language Studies Category
- Will use auto-detection approach for both languages
- Prompt will instruct Gemini to detect student's native language from context
- Prompt will instruct Gemini to detect target language from content
- `studentLanguage` parameter kept but not used in prompt

### Test Image Details

#### Test Image 1: Finnish Content
- **File:** `/assets/images/photo1.jpg`
- **Content:** Finnish fire safety educational material
- **Expected Output:** Questions and explanations in Finnish
- **Topic:** Fire safety ("Tulipalovaara kotona" - Fire hazard at home)
- **Purpose:** Verify automatic detection of Finnish language

#### Test Image 2: English Content
- **File:** `/assets/images/US-textbook1.jpg`
- **Content:** English textbook about energy and environment
- **Expected Output:** Questions and explanations in English
- **Topic:** Energy, climate action, environmental protection
- **Purpose:** Verify automatic detection of English language

### Edge Cases to Monitor
- What if content has multiple languages mixed?
- What if content is primarily visual (diagrams, math equations)?
- We'll observe these during testing phase

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- ✅ Only updating prompt template strings
- ✅ Not touching APIs, interfaces, or database
- ✅ Easy rollback via git revert

**No Breaking Changes:**
- ✅ API contracts remain unchanged
- ✅ Function signatures remain unchanged
- ✅ Mobile app integration unaffected

## Success Criteria

- [x] **Finnish Test:** ✅ Gemini automatically detected Finnish and generated 10/10 Finnish questions from photo1.jpg
- [x] **English Test:** ✅ Gemini automatically detected English and generated 10/10 English questions from US-textbook1.jpg
- [x] Questions generated in correct language without explicit language specification in prompt ✅
- [x] Console logs show no `${languageName}` variables in prompt for both tests ✅
- [x] No regression in question quality for either language ✅ (4.9/5 and 5.0/5 ratings)
- [x] All existing functionality continues to work ✅

**FINAL RESULT: ALL SUCCESS CRITERIA MET ✅**

## Rollback Plan

If language detection doesn't work reliably:
1. Run `git diff src/lib/config.ts` to see changes
2. Run `git checkout src/lib/config.ts` to revert
3. Re-test with original prompts

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1 (Prompt Analysis):** 30 minutes
- **Phase 2 (Update Prompts):** 1 hour
- **Phase 3 (Testing Setup):** 30 minutes
- **Phase 4 (Execute Tests):** 1 hour
- **Phase 5 (Documentation):** 30 minutes

**Total:** ~3.5 hours
