# Finnish Exam Generator - User Account System Specifications & Implementation Plan

## üéØ **System Overview**

This document outlines the implementation of a parent-child account system for the Finnish Exam Generator, where parents use a Flutter mobile app to create and manage exams, while children access exams directly through secure email links via web browser - no login required.

## üìã **Core Specifications**

### **Authentication Model**
- **Parents**: Google Sign-In authentication via Flutter app
- **Children**: Passwordless access through secure, tokenized email links
- **No child accounts**: Children never create accounts or passwords

### **Platform Distribution**
- **Flutter Mobile App**: Exclusive parent interface
- **Next.js Web App**: Child exam-taking interface (mobile-responsive)
- **Shared Backend**: Unified API, database, and AI processing

### **User Journey Overview**

#### **Parent Workflow (Flutter)**
1. Sign up/in with Google account
2. Add children (name, email, grade level)
3. Create exams using camera/gallery for image upload
4. Assign exams to specific children
5. Monitor real-time progress and results

#### **Child Workflow (Web)**
1. Receive email with direct exam link
2. Click link ‚Üí opens web browser ‚Üí immediate exam access
3. Complete exam and view results
4. No registration, login, or account management needed

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **Authentication Stack**
- **Supabase Auth** for parent Google Sign-In
- **JWT tokens** for API authentication
- **Secure access tokens** for child exam links
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for data isolation

### **Database Schema Design**

#### **Core Tables**
- **users**: Parent accounts only (Google auth integration)
- **children**: Child profiles (no auth accounts)
- **exams**: Enhanced with assignment capabilities
- **exam_access_tokens**: Secure tokenized access management
- **exam_attempts**: Child submission tracking
- **family_relationships**: Parent-child associations

### **Security Model**
- **Tokenized Links**: Each exam assignment generates unique, secure access token
- **Time-bounded Access**: Optional expiration dates for exam links
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of access and completion
- **Data Isolation**: Strict family-level data separation via RLS

### **Email System**
- **Welcome emails**: One-time child introduction to system
- **Exam notifications**: Direct links with exam details
- **Progress updates**: Parent notifications for child activity
- **Transactional email service**: Integrated with Supabase or external provider

## üìß **Email Workflow**

### **Child Onboarding**
1. Parent adds child in Flutter app
2. Welcome email sent to child explaining system
3. Child bookmarks student portal for future reference

### **Exam Assignment**
1. Parent creates and assigns exam
2. System generates unique access token per child
3. Email sent with direct exam link
4. Child clicks link ‚Üí immediate exam access
5. Real-time progress updates to parent

## üîí **Security & Privacy**

### **Child Data Protection**
- **Minimal data collection**: Only name, email, grade level
- **No authentication data**: No passwords or session management
- **Parental oversight**: All child data managed by parents
- **COPPA/GDPR compliant**: Age-appropriate data handling

### **Link Security**
- **Cryptographically secure tokens**: UUID or JWT-based
- **Child-specific access**: Tokens tied to specific child
- **Exam-specific scope**: Single exam access per token
- **Tamper-resistant**: Validation prevents unauthorized access

## üì± **User Experience Design**

### **Parent Interface (Flutter)**
- **Native mobile experience**: Camera integration, offline capabilities
- **Google Sign-In**: Familiar authentication flow
- **Family dashboard**: Centralized child and exam management
- **Real-time updates**: Live progress monitoring
- **Bulk operations**: Assign exams to multiple children

### **Child Interface (Web)**
- **Zero friction access**: Direct link ‚Üí immediate exam
- **Mobile-responsive**: Works on any device with browser
- **Child-friendly UI**: Age-appropriate design and language
- **Progress indicators**: Clear completion status
- **Results display**: Immediate feedback after submission
