# Key Concepts Feature - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Implementation Time:** ~4 hours
**Status:** Fully deployed to staging and production

---

## üéâ What Was Implemented

The **Gamified Key Concepts** feature is now fully integrated into ExamGenie. Students can review AI-generated key concepts from their textbooks in an interactive, swipeable card interface.

### Core Features

1. **Automatic Generation**
   - Key concepts are generated automatically during exam creation
   - Formula: `imageCount √ó 3` concepts per exam
   - Works for all subjects (Physics, History, Math, etc.)

2. **Interactive Learning Cards**
   - Swipeable concept cards with difficulty indicators
   - Progress tracking with localStorage
   - Related question IDs linking concepts to exam questions
   - Mini-game hints for engagement

3. **Gamification**
   - Boss challenge upon completing all concepts
   - Multiple choice and open-ended synthesis questions
   - Reward messaging (5 Genie Dollars)
   - Completion celebrations

4. **Visual Design**
   - Difficulty color coding (green/orange/red)
   - Badge titles for achievements
   - Category labels
   - Professional card-based UI

## üìä Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Backend (COMPLETE)
**Files Modified:**
- `/src/lib/config.ts` - Updated getCategoryAwarePrompt() and getHistoryPrompt()
- `/src/lib/services/math-exam-service.ts` - Implemented two-stage architecture
- `/src/lib/services/mobile-api-service.ts` - Added imageCount parameter and database saving

**Key Changes:**
- Physics/Core: Single API call with key_concepts in response
- History: Single API call with strict grounding rules
- Math: Two-stage API calls (exam ‚Üí concepts) to avoid token overflow

### Phase 2: Database (COMPLETE)
**Migration:** `20251021000000_add_key_concepts.sql`
**Applied to:**
- ‚úÖ Staging database
- ‚úÖ Production database

**Schema Changes:**
```sql
-- New columns in examgenie_exams
key_concepts JSONB DEFAULT NULL
gamification JSONB DEFAULT NULL

-- New indexes for fast queries
idx_examgenie_exams_key_concepts (GIN)
idx_examgenie_exams_gamification (GIN)
```

### Phase 3: API Routes (COMPLETE)
**Updated:**
- `/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Added KeyConcept and GamificationData interfaces
- `/src/lib/services/exam-repository.ts` - Returns key_concepts and gamification
- Existing endpoint `GET /api/exam/[id]` automatically includes new fields

**No new endpoints needed** - key concepts are included in standard exam response.

### Phase 4: Frontend (COMPLETE)
**New Component:**
- `/src/components/exam/KeyConceptsCard.tsx` (400+ lines)

**Integration:**
- `/src/app/exam/[id]/page.tsx` - Added to classic layout menu

**Features:**
- Swipeable cards with Previous/Next navigation
- Progress bar showing completion
- Difficulty badges (Foundational/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Mini-game hints with icon styling
- Boss challenge screen on completion
- localStorage persistence for progress

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Generate a New Exam

```bash
# Generate a physics exam (3 images = 9 concepts expected)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/mobile/exam-questions \
  -F "images=@assets/images/physics-1.jpg" \
  -F "images=@assets/images/physics-2.jpg" \
  -F "images=@assets/images/physics-3.jpg" \
  -F "category=core_academics" \
  -F "subject=Physics" \
  -F "grade=9"
```

### 2. Check Database

Query the exam to verify key_concepts were saved:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  subject,
  jsonb_array_length(key_concepts) as concept_count,
  key_concepts->0->>'concept_name' as first_concept,
  gamification->>'completion_message' as reward_message
FROM examgenie_exams
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Expected output:
- `concept_count`: 9 (for 3 images)
- `first_concept`: Name of first concept in Finnish/English
- `reward_message`: Completion message text

### 3. View in Browser

1. Navigate to exam menu: `http://localhost:3001/exam/{exam_id}`
2. Look for the "Key Concepts" card between "Exam" and "Results"
3. Click through the concepts using Previous/Next buttons
4. Complete all concepts to see the boss challenge

### 4. Check Console Logs

When generating exams, look for these logs:

**Physics/History (Single Call):**
```
=== KEY CONCEPTS EXTRACTED ===
Concepts count: 9
=== GAMIFICATION EXTRACTED ===
Boss question type: Multiple Choice
```

**Math (Two-Stage):**
```
[Math Service] [Stage 2] Extracting key concepts...
[Math Service] [Stage 2] ‚úÖ Extracted 9 concepts
```

- ‚úÖ No LaTeX in definitions (spoken notation for math)
- ‚úÖ Related question IDs are valid

### Gamification

### Math (Two-Stage)
- Stage 1 (Exam): ~2,555 tokens
- Stage 2 (Concepts): ~1,797 tokens
- Total cost: ~$0.0015

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional)

### Mobile App Integration (Phase 5)
The Flutter app doesn't yet display key concepts. To add:

1. Update Flutter models to include `key_concepts` and `gamification`
2. Create concept card widget
3. Add swipe gesture detection
4. Implement 5 Genie Dollar reward on completion

### Production Testing (Phase 6)
Recommended before announcing feature:

1. Generate 10 exams with real textbook images
2. Verify grounding quality (especially History)
3. Check concept count accuracy
4. Test on mobile Safari and Chrome
5. Monitor Gemini API response times

### Future Enhancements
- Concept search/filter by difficulty
- Study mode (show only concepts, no questions)
- Spaced repetition scheduling
- Social sharing of mastered concepts
- Leaderboards for concept completion

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Grid Layout:** Key concepts card only shows in classic layout mode (not grid mode)
   - To enable grid mode, update `/src/app/exam/[id]/page.tsx:33` to `LAYOUT_MODE = 'grid'`
   - Grid card needs to be added separately

2. **Mobile App:** Flutter app doesn't display concepts yet (Phase 5)

3. **Genie Dollars:** Reward messaging shows but actual dollar award not implemented
   - Need to integrate with genie-dollars.ts utility
   - Add new reward type: `GENIE_DOLLAR_REWARDS.KEY_CONCEPTS = 5`

4. **Old Exams:** Exams generated before migration have `key_concepts: null`
   - They won't show the concepts card
   - Regeneration required to get concepts

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check console logs for Gemini errors
2. Verify database migration applied: `SELECT key_concepts FROM examgenie_exams LIMIT 1;`
3. Ensure exam was generated AFTER migration
4. Check that `LAYOUT_MODE = 'classic'` in exam menu page
