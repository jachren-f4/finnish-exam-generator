## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test completed successfully
2. ⏳ Review questions for any edge cases
3. ⏳ Test with other history topics (world history, geography, etc.)
4. ⏳ Integrate into production code
5. ⏳ Update mobile API to route history category to new prompt

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Add to PROMPTS in config.ts
```typescript
export const PROMPTS = {
  getCategoryAwarePrompt: ...,
  getMathPrompt: ...,
  getHistoryPrompt: (grade, language) => { ... }
}
```

### Option 2: Create history-exam-service.ts
Similar to `math-exam-service.ts` pattern:
```typescript
// src/lib/services/history-exam-service.ts
export async function generateHistoryExam(...)
```

### Option 3: Enhance existing prompt with category logic
Add history-specific guidance to `getCategoryAwarePrompt()` when `category === 'history'`
